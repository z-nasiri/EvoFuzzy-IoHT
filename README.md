# EvoFuzzy-IoHT
The surge of IoHT data challenges real-time availability in cloud-fog systems. We propose a Hybrid Classical-Fuzzy Heuristic (HCFH) with evolutionary tuning for optimal placement, replication, and mobility. Results show up to 28% faster response, 22% higher acceptance, and 17% lower energy use.
